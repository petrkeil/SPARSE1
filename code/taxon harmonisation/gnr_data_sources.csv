"1","2012-07-06T11:36:36Z",NA,NA,"The Catalogue of Life is an assembly of expert-based global species checklists with the aim to build a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, but for now, it probably includes just over 80% of the world's known species. The Catalogue of Life estimates 2.3M extant species on the planet recognised by taxonomists at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users may notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.

It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge.

Both of the Biodiversity Research Center and the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and the updating biodiversity related information and data.

Through the node, the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences, name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database, biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed. Among them, ""Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists"" and ""Catalog of Life of Taiwan"" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council. So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.

The first phase of Catalog of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects), plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names, endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004.

Abstract of the Belgian Species List project:
Since almost a year now, people of all ages can access the Belgian Species List for an extensive overview of the biodiversity in Belgium. Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of more than 32.000 species!

The Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS – the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences – in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.

The purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that's been described, information is given on among other things the conservation status, the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards are fitted with pictures and interesting links.

The website is aimed at a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature conversationists and all nature lovers.

The taxonomic backbone is based on the Species 2000 & ITIS Catalogue of Life (2015 release). The literature database contains circa 1300 references, spanning from 1535 to present. This dataset represents the output of an ongoing endeavor, and therefore is periodically updated.
